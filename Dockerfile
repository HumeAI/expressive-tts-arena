# Install uv and required system dependencies
#   - `apt-get update` fetches the latest package lists
#   - `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl libpq-dev gcc build-essential` installs:
#       - curl: to fetch the uv installer script
#       - libpq-dev: provides pg_config required by psycopg2
#       - gcc & build-essential: required for compiling C extensions (e.g. psycopg2)
#   - `curl -LsSf` downloads and runs the uv installer script
#   - `apt-get remove -y curl` removes curl after installation to save space
#   - `apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` removes cached package lists to reduce image size

# Copy dependency files first (pyproject.toml & uv.lock) to leverage Dockerâ€™s build cache

#   - Reads pyproject.toml (and uv.lock, if available) to install dependencies

# Document the port used by Gradio
#   - This does not actually expose the port, it is just metadata for users
#   - To actually expose the port, use `docker run -p 7860:7860 <image>`

# Define the command to start the application
#   - `uv run` ensures that the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are up to date
#   - `python -m src.main` runs the main application module
